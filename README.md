# SQL-Finance-and-Supplychain-Analytics

This project involved working with a real dataset containing over 1 million records. The aim was to simulate industry-style data analysis and optimization tasks.

## Key Skills & Concepts Covered:

- **SQL Basics**: Mastered foundational commands like `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `BETWEEN`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY` for data querying and filtering.
- **Joins**: Implemented various types of joins (e.g., `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `INNER`, `FULL`, `CROSS`) to combine data from multiple tables efficiently.
- **Subqueries & CTEs**: Utilized **subqueries** and **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)** for modular and readable query designs.
- **Views & Temporary Tables**: Created **views** and managed **temporary tables** for reusable and transient data storage.
- **Data Warehousing**: Gained insights into **ETL processes**, **Data Warehouses**, and both **OLAP** and **OLTP** systems for efficient data processing.
- **User-Defined Functions (UDFs) & Stored Procedures**: Wrote custom **UDFs** and **stored procedures** to handle complex data manipulations.
- **Window Functions**: Used window functions like `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, and `DENSE_RANK()` for advanced data ranking and partitioning.

This project sharpened my SQL skills by simulating real-world data analytics challenges, providing me with the ability to work with large datasets in a professional setting.
